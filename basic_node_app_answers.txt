1. What is a Node module?
- A node module is an extension to the node enviroment that a developer is able to import to their project in order
  to solve a specific problem.

2. What is the main difference between exports and module.exports?
- exports is a reference to module.exports and cannot reassign it. The way they are used in the checkpoint, they can
  be used interchangeably, but setting setting module.exports to any object or primitive resets the object, overwriting
  any other methods you've added up to that point.

3. Why is using exports recommended?
- Using exports allows you to reference module.exports without the danger of accidentally overwriting the object itself.
  module.exports is the object returned from require(), not exports.
